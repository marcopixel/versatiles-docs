## What is VersaTiles?

It is a fully free and open-source stack for generating, distrubuting and using map tiles based on OpenStreetMap data, free of any commercial interests.

While many websites rely on commercial providers, these come with costs in terms of money and privacy. Free alternatives exist but often require significant time and effort to set up, maintain, and customize.

VersaTiles simplifies this process by offering ready-to-use, highly customizable, and extensible modules. We provide a complete solution that can be used as-is or just in parts, depending on your needs.

Our goal is to make it easy for anyone to host their own web maps.

You can learn more about the project in our [Project Philosophy]() section.

## Use Cases

VersaTiles is designed to be used as an open & free alternative to commercial map providers like [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com), [Bing Maps](https://www.bing.com/maps), or [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com).

It is especially useful for projects that require a high level of customization, privacy, or control over the map data and infrastructure. It's also a great choice if you want to avoid high costs associated with commercial providers.
